# Inverse Kinematics Benchmark for Inverse Modelling

This repository hosts the forward problem and solution methods for the inverse problem.

The code builds on https://github.com/vislearn/inn_toy_data/.

The benchmark was proposed first in the following paper:

Kruse, J., Ardizzone, L., Rother, C., & KÃ¶the, U. (2021). Benchmarking Invertible Architectures on Inverse Problems (arXiv:2101.10763). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2101.10763
